## Welcome to Snapfinger
# Chatting webapp built using Express on the backend, plain HTML/JS on the front

## Current Features:
* Account creation, chatroom creation, invite other users to chatroom, chatting
* Uses client-side polling to update information - looking into WebSocket functionality for potential future implementation

## Notes:
* Most of this project is a rough prototype and is definitely not production-ready
* Pretty please, don't use my API keys?
